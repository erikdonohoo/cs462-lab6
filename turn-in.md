see_songs

* b506845x2.prod

**Questions**
1. I got a single directive back.  One rule ran.
2. I got two directives back, and two rules ran.  One in echo, and one in see_songs
3. The second time there was a second event listener and it responded to the event as well as the first listener so I got both responses back.
